### Setting Up Environment Variables

To configure NFTic-Marketplace, you need to set up environment variables. We use a `.env` file to manage these variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file:** In the project root directory, create a file named `.env`.

2. **Add environment variables:** Add the required environment variables to your `.env` file.

3. **Add comments (important!):** When adding environment variables, it's crucial to provide comments explaining their purpose and any specific configuration details. This helps other developers understand their usage.

Here's an example of how to format your `.env` file:

```env
# PRIVATE KEY
PRIVATE_KEY='your-private-key'

```
